# Downloading web pages with Python

This little bit of code is from a tutorial on the website [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) titled, funnily enough, [Downloading Web Pages With Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/working-with-web-pages). There are several tutorials that follow this one, beginning with[From HTML to List of Words, Part 1](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/?topic=python).

I need to follow up on these tutorials, but I have noticed a compatibility problem. The tutorials were created in 2012 with Python 2, and so some of the code is a bit archaic. In fact, I'm surprised the code for the current tutorial worked as expected.
