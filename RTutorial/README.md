# Using Geospatial Data to Inform Historical Research in R

This repo houses the code for a [tutorial from The Programming Historian website](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/geospatial-data-analysis). For this project I have been using the RStudio app for programming with the R language.

I am a little hung up on some code that is not producing the expected results, so I need to figure out the glitch. Fascinating stuff though.
